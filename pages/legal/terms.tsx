                      Revenue generated by Fans paying to view User Content
                      uploaded by you or for Fan Interaction. The difference
                      between the Revenue and Commission being a management fee

                      Creator. In other words, WHG receives the Revenue and
                      holds the Commission on behalf of the Creator and not on
                      your behalf as a Fan. Once WHG receives payment from you,
                      you have no further liability to the Creator and the

                      Content until the end of the current billing period but

                      To view a Creator's Content and/or utilize the Fan
                      Interaction function on HoneyDrip, you must first add a
                      payment card to your account and then click the

                      You authorize WHG to supply your payment card details to a

                      your Fan Payment. All Fan Payments will be charged in USD.
                      Your Payment Provider may charge you currency conversion

                      If you have provided two or more payment cards on your

                      you attempt to make a Fan Payment, the other payment card

                    <li>
                      The payment provider will take (i) monthly payments from

                      Fan Interaction function on a Creator's account or paying
                      a tip to the Creator. You authorize and consent to each of
                      these payments being debited using your supplied payment
                      card details.

                      Apart from free-trial Subscriptions, all Subscriptions to
                      a Creator's profile will automatically renew at the end of
                      the monthly subscription period, except if your payment
                      card was declined, the subscription price has increased,
                      or you have turned off the "Auto-Renew" switch located on
                      the relevant Creator's profile. This means that if you
                      want to stop subscribing to a Creator's profile and paying
                      continuing monthly subscription charges, you must turn off
                      the "Auto-Renew" switch located on the relevant Creator's
                      profile.

                    <li>
                      If you cancel a Subscription, you will continue to be
                      permitted to view the relevant Creator's Content until the
                      end of the subscription period in which you cancelled,
                      after which no further payments will be taken from your
                      payment card in respect of subscriptions to that Creator's
                      profile, and you will no longer be able to view the
                      relevant Creator's Content.

                    <li>
                      You agree that you will not make unjustified requests for

                      unjustified Chargeback requests with your Payment Provider
                      in relation to any transaction between you and a Creator.
                      If WHG considers that any request for a Refund or
                      Chargeback request was made by you in bad faith, we have

                      Wallet Credits. You can prepay Wallet Credits which you
                      can later use to make Fan Payments. Purchases on HoneyDrip
                      cannot be divided - if you attempt a purchase that costs
                      more than the total amount of your remaining Wallet
                      Credits, your payment card will be charged the full amount
                      for that purchase. You are entitled upon request (whether
                      before or after the termination of your agreement with us)
                      to a refund of unused Wallet Credits, unless we reasonably
                      determine that your request for a refund is not made in
                      good faith.

                  Service, then any Fan Payments which would otherwise have
                  fallen due during the period of suspension of your User
                  Account will be suspended during the period of the suspension

                      to HoneyDrip, rather than to Fans directly. For VAT
                      purposes only, you will charge HoneyDrip your Creator
                      Earnings (80% of all and any Fan Payments), together with
                      UK VAT at the prevailing rate in force at the time of the
                      Fan Payment. If you are a Creator in the UK who is not
                      required to register for UK VAT, then you should monitor
                      the level of taxable sales that you make in the UK
                      (including any Referral Payments) to ensure you have not

                      your obligation, as a taxable person, to monitor whether
                      you have exceeded the VAT registration threshold.
