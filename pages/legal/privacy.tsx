                  Consumer Request by an Authorized Agent If any authorized

                  confirm that person or entity’s authority to act on your

                      To verify your identity, depending on the nature of the

                      (not expired), email address, and the last 4 digits of the

                  We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal

                  the request and confirm the personal data relates to you.
                  Making a verifiable consumer request does not require to
                  create an account with us. However, if you do have an existing
                  login, we will require you to log in to submit a request. We
                  will only use personal data provided in a verifiable consumer
                  request to verify the request’s identity or authority to make
                  the request.
                  <br />
                  We will acknowledge receipt of the request within ten (10)
                  business days of its receipt. We will respond to a verifiable
                  consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt.
                  If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of
                  the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an
                  account with us, we will deliver our written response to that
                  account. If you do not have an account with us, we will

                  we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the
                  receipt of the verifiable consumer request. The response we
                  provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a
                  request, if applicable. For Data Portability requests, we will
                  provide the responsive information in a portable and, to the
                  extent technically feasible, in a readily useable format that
                  allows you to transmit the information to another entity
                  without hindrance.
                  <br />
                  We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your
                  verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive,
                  repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the
                  request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that
                  decision and provide you with a cost estimate before
                  completing your request.

                  <u>Payment Information</u>. Payments made by Fans to access
                  content are processed by our third party Payment Providers.
                  For example, when you make a payment that is processed by a
                  payment provider, you will provide that third party with your
                  credit card number, credit card expiration date, and security
                  code, which they process and store subject to their privacy
                  policy and terms of service. We do not receive your full
                  credit card number, credit card expiration date, or the
                  security code. Instead, the payment provider provides us with
                  a “token” that represents your account, your card’s expiration
                  date, card type and the first two and last four digits of your
                  card number. If you are required to provide your name and
                  email address to the payment provider, then they also provide
                  us with that information. Payments issued to Creators for
                  their content are made by HoneyDrip using the bank account
                  information that we have collected and stored.
